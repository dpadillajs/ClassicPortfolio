# Classic Portfolio

My original portfolio was made from scratch with absolutely no templates using just HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, and jQuery. My hope is that my portfolio's visual design tells a story about how meticulous I am in making sure that everything is just right from the desktop to mobile users.

### Skills Learned

My portfolio is a culmination of everything I have learned in class leading up to React. I did however integrate some JavaScript plug-ins that I recoded to visually make my own such as the iMac carousel and the progression bars.

### Comments

This portfolio is meant to be a stepping stone to having a conversation in-person to discuss how I can bring my best work to your team in order to make a successful product or service.
